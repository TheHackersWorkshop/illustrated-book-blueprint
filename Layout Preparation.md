## Book Layout Preparation (Step-by-Step) 
Before you write a single word, the book’s format and structure should be fully prepped. This avoids rework later, especially when combining illustrations and text. The goal is to have your entire document behave like a pre-built container, ready to receive the story and images as you create them.

Step 1: Define Trim Size and Layout Style
Choose your final book size (e.g., 6" x 9"). This is the physical print size.
Open LibreOffice Writer and create a new document with that exact page size:
Save this as your master template (or reuse an existing one if you've already set one up for similar work).
 

Step 2: Add Core Book Structure
Before writing, pre-define and insert these structural elements:

Title page
Copyright page
Optional: Table of Contents (not always needed for illustrated children’s books)
Page breaks between sections to control flow
Add placeholder pages for:

Use manual page breaks (Insert > More Breaks > Manual Break) to ensure full control over layout. 

Step 3: Set Page Layout Zones (for Text & Image)
Each page of your story will follow a consistent visual structure: 

Top (or bottom) half: reserved for paragraph text
Remaining area: reserved for the illustration

To prepare for this: 

Use frames or text boxes to mark the areas:

 This allows you to visually assess spacing, text length, and the relationship between text and artwork before inserting anything final.

Step 4: Set Paragraph & Style Defaults
Define your paragraph style (font, size, spacing) using LibreOffice Styles:
Apply this style to all story text areas.

This ensures formatting consistency and avoids manual reformatting later.

Step 5: Add Placeholder Notes or Annotations (Optional)
In each page frame, you can add comments or notes like:
These will guide your Blender storyboard scenes and keep text/image coordination tight.

Step 6: Save and Version Your File
Name your file clearly: IllustratedBook_Layout_Master.odt
Back it up and version as needed (_v1, _v2, etc.)
You’re now ready to storyboard and begin your visual development, knowing exactly how much room your text and illustrations will occupy.
