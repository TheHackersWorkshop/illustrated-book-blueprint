## Illustrating from Screenshots
Tools: GIMP (raster-based), optionally Inkscape (vector-based) Goal: Create hand-drawn illustrations using Blender screenshots as pose references

Step 1: Set Up Your Illustration Canvas
Open GIMP and create a new canvas sized to your book's illustration area. For a 6" x 9" book with illustrations taking the top 6" x 6":
Save your canvas as a working .xcf file (e.g., scene03_drinking.xcf)

Step 2: Import Screenshot as Reference Laye 
Drag your matching Blender screenshot into GIMP as a new layer.
Position or scale it to fit your layout bounds.
Reduce its opacity to ~25–30% so you can draw over it clearly.
Lock this layer to prevent accidental changes. 

Step 3: Line Art & Inking
Add a new transparent layer above the screenshot.
Begin inking the character directly over the screenshot:
Draw only the character and key props or details—no background yet.

Step 4: Background & Composition
Add a soft-focus background in a separate layer group:
Backgrounds should support the scene but not distract from the character.

Step 5: Shading, Color, and Detail
Use additional layers for:
Flatten the illustration only when completely done.

Step 6: Export Final Illustration
Export as high-res PNG or TIFF for inserting into your book layout.
Keep the working .xcf for future edits or corrections.
Name each file clearly (e.g., page03_final.png).

 

Optional: Vector Illustration with Inkscape
If you prefer clean, scalable lines:

Import the screenshot into Inkscape and trace over it using the Pen tool.
Use vector layers to build the character and background components.
Export to PNG at 300 DPI once complete. 

Once illustrations are complete for each page, they can be dropped directly into your final LibreOffice Writer layout.
