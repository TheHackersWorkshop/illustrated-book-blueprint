This guide outlines a structured process for creating an illustrated book—from planning and visualization to layout and publishing—using open-source tools and a storyboard-driven workflow. It is designed for creators who want to manage every step themselves, with full creative ownership of both text and artwork.



Overview of Process
The focus of this method is planning first, execution second. The workflow assumes the creator will handle writing, illustration, and layout in-house, using software as tools—not as content generators.

The process emphasizes:

Visualizing the entire book before starting
Using consistent 3D posing for illustration reference
Building all components directly into a final-layout template from day one
Minimizing rework by assembling the book as a unified system

 

Tools Used
 

Task | Tool

Writing & Layout | LibreOffice Writer (final trim size from the start)

Storyboarding / Pose Reference | Blender

Illustration (Line Art / Final Art) | GIMP or Inkscape
