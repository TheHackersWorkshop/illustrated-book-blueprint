## Storyboarding with Blender
This phase is about using Blender to visually block out your story—scene by scene—before drawing. The goal is not to render or animate final visuals, but to pose your main character, frame the camera, and simulate the progression of your story through animation screenshots. These screenshots will later serve as base layers for your illustrations.

Step 1: Import and Prepare Your 3D Model
Open Blender and import your 3D model of the main character (e.g., a horse or unicorn).
If the model isn’t rigged (doesn’t have bones), use basic posing tools:
Keep the mesh simple. You don’t need textures, materials, or lighting at this point.
Save this Blender file as your Storyboard Master File.

Step 2: Create a Blank Storyboard Timeline
Use Blender’s timeline and keyframes to create a rough story arc:
Keep scenes on fixed keyframe intervals to allow quick navigation.

Optional:

Add simple camera movements or scene transitions if you intend to build it out into a full animation later.

Step 3: Pose Character Scene by Scene
For each scene:
Repeat for all story moments until each paragraph has a corresponding screenshot. 

Step 4: Screenshot Library = Visual Blueprint
You now have a scene-by-scene visual storyboard: 

Store all screenshots in a single folder (e.g., /storyboard-shots/) and match each one to the corresponding page in your LibreOffice document.

Step 5: Sync Screenshots with Book Layout
Insert low-res versions of the screenshots into your Writer template as placeholders.
Use these to test how your text and images fit together per page.
This will help you ensure that:
 

With your storyboard complete, you’re ready to begin illustration production—using each Blender screenshot as a base layer to draw your final art.
