Tool: LibreOffice Writer Goal: Draft story text directly into a fully formatted book layout, one paragraph per page, aligned with illustration planning.

Use the template you created in section one. Or continue from here.

Step 1: Start with Final Trim Size
Create a new document at your final book size (e.g., 6" x 9").
Set up:
Save this as a reusable template (.ott) for future projects.
 

Step 2: Establish Page Structure
Decide on the fixed text and image zones per page:
Use consistent spacing and font styles throughout:

Step 3: Draft One Scene Per Page

Once final illustrations are ready, simply replace the placeholder image with the finished art.

Step 5: Continuous Adjustment Loop 
As you write and lay out each scene:

This iterative approach gives you full control and lets you shape the story organicallyâ€”words and visuals growing together page by page.

Once the full draft is written and illustrations are finalized, you'll be ready to generate a print-ready PDF and begin the publishing phase.
