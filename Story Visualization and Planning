## Story Visualization and Planning

Before any writing or illustration begins, the entire story should be visualized as a sequence—like watching a short animated film in your mind. This mental rehearsal gives you a clear blueprint of what you want to communicate, how each scene will feel, and what needs to be illustrated. 

Step 1: Visualize the Entire Story
Play the story out in your mind like a looping film.
Write down what you see—start with the major beats or moments.
Each time you replay the story mentally, add more detail:
These mental passes will build up the structure of your story without forcing it.
Write what you want to share emotionally and visually.

Step 2: Begin Imagery Planning
Identify the main character or focal figures for illustration.
Search for a free 3D model online that closely matches your main character's body shape or design.
Don’t worry about color, texture, or realism—this is a posing tool only.

Step 3: Gather and Install Creative Tools
Ensure you have the right open-source software installed and ready. All tools used should support the full pipeline from draft to publication:

Tool | Purpose

LibreOffice Writer | Text layout and book formatting (e.g., KDP-ready 6"x9")

Blender | Storyboarding and posing 3D model scenes

GIMP | Drawing, inking, and coloring illustrations

Inkscape | Optional: Vector illustrations, layout refinement, or SVG-based drawings

All software listed is free and open source, suitable for both drafting and final production work.

Once the mental story is clear and your tools are in place, you’ll be ready to start storyboarding and animating each scene to match your narrative—one pose at a time.
